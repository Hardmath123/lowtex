   LowTeX--pronounced "low-tech"--is a small text transformation package that   
generates pretty monospace outputs, specifically for READMEs, licenses, or even 
large block comments. This documentation was generated by LowTeX, and its       
source is bundled with the package. We will walk through the basics of LowTeX   
here.

compile, use the `lowtex` command.       restore a setting to its previous

   A LowTeX document consists of text,      A block is declared with the line   
with interspersed DIRECTIVES, which      `@begin <name> <arguments>`, and       
are prefixed with an `@`. A directive    terminated with the line `@end`.
