   LowTeX--pronounced "low-tech"--is a small text transformation package that   
generates pretty monospace outputs, specifically for READMEs, licenses, or even 
large block comments. This documentation was generated by LowTeX, and its       
source is bundled with the package. We will walk through the basics of LowTeX   
here. The source for this tutorial is in `example.lt`.
