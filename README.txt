   LowTeX--pronounced "low-tech"--is a small text transformation package that   
generates pretty monospace outputs, specifically for READMEs, licenses, or even 
large block comments. This documentation was generated by LowTeX, and its       
source is bundled with the package. We will walk through the basics of LowTeX   
here.                                                                           
                                                                                
Getting started                                                                 
------- -------                                                                 
   Install LowTeX with `npm install -g lowtex`. Create a new document in your   
favorite text editor, preferably set to a mode that wraps lines of text. To     
compile, use the `lowtex` command.                                              
                                                                                
   A LowTeX document consists of text, with interspersed DIRECTIVES, which are  
prefixed with an `@`. A directive is either a SETTING, a BLOCK, or a COMMAND.   
Text is processed line-by-line, being wrapped and aligned according to the      
settings. A blank line (or directive) indicates the end of a paragraph. A line  
prefixed with `#` is a comment and is skipped silently.                         
                                                                                
   A setting is declared with the line `@set <name> <value>`. LowTeX mantains   
an internal stack of settings. To restore a setting to its previous value, use  
`@unset <name>`.                                                                
   A block is declared with the line `@begin <name> <arguments>`, and           
terminated with the line `@end`. Blocks transform the text inside them. An      
example of a block is the UNDERLINE block, which underlines the text inside it. 
   A command is simply `@<name> <arguments>`. For example, @VSPACE N adds `n`   
blank lines.
