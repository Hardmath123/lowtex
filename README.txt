   LowTeX--pronounced "low-tech"--is a small text transformation package that   
generates pretty monospace outputs, specifically for READMEs, licenses, or even 
large block comments. This documentation was generated by LowTeX, and its       
source is bundled with the package. We will walk through the basics of LowTeX   
here. The source for this tutorial is in `example.lt`.                          
                                                                                
Getting started

   Install LowTeX with `npm install -g

to a mode that wraps lines of text. To   an internal stack of settings. To      
compile, use the `lowtex` command.       restore a setting to its previous      
                                         value, use `@unset <name>`.            
   A LowTeX document consists of text,      A block is declared with the line   
with interspersed DIRECTIVES, which      `@begin <name> <arguments>`, and       
are prefixed with an `@`. A directive    terminated with the line `@end`.

The Plugin System                                                               
-----------------                                                               
   You might notice that the heading above was underlined differently from the  
other ones you've seen thus far. That is because it was created using a special 
underlining plugin. Plugins allow developers to define their own custom         
commands and blocks via the use of node modules. To include a plugin, put the   
module's .js file in the working directory when you run lowtex. Then put        
`@plugin <plugin-name>` in your .lt file before you use the plugin's features.  
   The plugin used in this file can be found in demo.js, and contains the       
commands and filters: `@underline-all <padding>`, '@<begin/end> reverse',       
`@horizontal-line [length]'.                                                    
   Plugins were implemented by Sam Lazarus (@sl).
