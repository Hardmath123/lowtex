Plugins are used to add commands and features to Lowtex without forcing the     
user to modifythe source of the application. reverse-demo.lt is demoing a very  
simplistic plugin that reverses the order of every word in the defined area.    
You can import a plugin by using `@plugin <path>` where path is the path to the 
plugins file. It is reccomended that plugins use the extension `.ltr`. The      
effect of this can be seen below:                                               
                                                                                
                                  olleH !dlrow                                  
                                                                                
The orriginal text in this case is hello world.                                 
                                                                                
The source for the plugin can be found in reverse.ltp
