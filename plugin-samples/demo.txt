This underline with internal whitespace also underlined is written in the       
plugin demo.js as well! It even has variable padding!This plugin is more        
advanced and is intended to show the potential of plugins, and is not a good    
example to learn from. To find examples that areeasier to understand, look at   
reverse and horizontal-line first.

------------------                                                              
                                                                                
Plugins are used to add commands and features to Lowtex without forcing the     
user to modify the source of the application. demo.js is a very simplistic      
plugin that reverses the order of every word in the defined area. It is         
intended purely as a demo of the plugin system, but is still fully usable. You  
can import a plugin by using `@plugin <path>` where path is the path to the     
plugins file. The effect of this can be seen below:                             
                                                                                
                                  olleH !dlrow                                  
                                                                                
The orriginal text in this case is hello world.                                 
                                                                                
The source for the plugin can be found in demo.js. In this case, the plugin is  
adding a filter to Lowtex. Filters are used to create blocks.                   
                                                                                
Plugins can also add commands. The following is a demonstration of a plugin     
that makes a horizontal line across the width of the document. The source for   
this plugin can be found in demo.js                                             
                                                                                
The horizontal line looks like this:                                            
                                                                                
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                
Or with a specified length (in this case 30 characters) like this:              
                                                                                
------------------------------
